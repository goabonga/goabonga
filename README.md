## Hey there, I'm Chris! 👋

When I was young, my grandfather was passionate about **RF** and was a pioneer in selling computers in France. It was a real opportunity for me — I started to write code in **1989** on a **Sharp MZ 700**, and since that day, I have never stopped. 💻✨

🚀 **FullStack DevOps Engineer** passionate about building **high availability infrastructure** for **scalable applications**.  
🔒 Strong background in **security**, **system development**, **Linux**, **malware analysis**, **pentesting**, **hardware**, **signal**, and **IoT**.

### 👨‍💻 Dev & Tech Aficionado
#### 🐍 Python (and FastAPI)

[![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-009688?style=for-the-badge&logo=fastapi&logoColor=white)](#)

After years of coding in PHP for the web, I've become a full-blown **Python enthusiast** — and FastAPI is now my go-to framework. 🐍✨  
I’m focused on **Machine Learning (MLOps)**, creating tools tailored to both product needs and **ML Engineers'** requirements, allowing them to deploy new models fully autonomously.  
Whether you need a **custom ML solution** or an end-to-end **data pipeline**, I’m here to help you create the right infrastructure to power your models. 🤖📊

#### ⚡ TypeScript (with a sprinkle of nostalgia)

[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=black)](#)

My journey with JavaScript started way back in **2000**. I've coded in **ActionScript 1 and 2**, lived through the **death of Flash** and ActionScript, and witnessed the birth of **Node.js** and **TypeScript**... oh, what a ride it's been! 😅  
I have a solid background in **TypeScript** and am experienced in guiding and architecting projects in it. Nowadays, I consider myself more of an **advisor and architect**, ready to help you shape your projects, make the right technical decisions, and navigate the modern frontend landscape — including frameworks like **React**. 📐💻

Over the years, I’ve gained deep expertise in various services offered by **AWS** and **Google Cloud Platform**. 🌩️  
I’ve also developed tools to manage infrastructures easily with **IaC** (Infrastructure as Code) — think **Terragrunt**, **Terraform** — all wrapped with a **GitOps** methodology. Automating, managing, securing, and optimizing infrastructure is my jam. ⚡🛠️

### 🚢 Kubernetes Maestro

[![MicroK8s](https://img.shields.io/badge/MicroK8s-FF7E00?style=for-the-badge&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white)](#)

Like everything else infra-related, I apply **GitOps principles** to Kubernetes as well. I’ve developed **Helm charts**, created **operators**, and worked on **MicroK8s addons**.  
I even maintain a **private registry for Helm charts** when there are no existing solutions (or if they’ve been abandoned). My goal is always to ensure projects have all the tools they need without reinventing the wheel. 🌀⚓

I can **help, train, and equip** you with everything you need for **DevOps, GitOps, SecOps, and MLOps**. Over time, I’ve gained a lot of experience with **ISO standards**, **security certifications**, and best practices to ensure that your systems are both **secure and stable**. 🚀🔐

### 🖥️ Sys Admin

I’ve always had a passion for system administration and the nuts and bolts of making servers run smoothly. Whether it's managing infrastructure, troubleshooting complex issues, or setting up new environments, **Linux** is my home.  
On top of that, I also **maintain packages** for **Arch Linux** — keeping things fresh, up-to-date, and optimized for anyone in the Arch community. ⚙️🖥️
